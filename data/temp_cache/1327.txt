QUESTION 1: What is Klarna, and how does it work on Tradera?
ANSWER: Klarna is a payment method that buyers can use to pay for their purchases on Tradera. When a buyer selects Klarna as their payment method, the seller transfers the right to receive payment from the buyer to Tradera, and Tradera then transfers that claim to Klarna. Buyers are obligated to make payment to Klarna, and not to the seller or Tradera.
