QUESTION: What conditions must a Seller meet in order to use Tradera's seller protection? 
ANSWER: In order for a Seller to be able to use Tradera's seller protection, the Seller shall send the goods to the delivery address approved by Tradera at the time of payment. Goods whose price exceeds 200 SEK must have been handed over to the Buyer by the Seller or by a carrier in order for the Seller to be covered by the seller protection. If the Buyer claims not to have received the delivery, Tradera will ask the Seller for evidence that the Seller, or the contracted carrier, has delivered the item or items to the Buyer. Tradera therefore recommends the Seller to send the goods with traceability, e.g., a tracking number from the carrier.
