QUESTION: Who is responsible for packaging the parcel to avoid damages?
ANSWER: The sender is responsible for properly packaging the parcel so that it won't be broken in transit. They need to ensure that the item is packed in such a way that the content or other parcels are not damaged by the package. Sufficient packing material should be used so that the item is immovable, and the package should be able to handle a fall from a table.
