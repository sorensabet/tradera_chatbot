QUESTION 1: What is a purchase request and how does it work?
ANSWER: A purchase request is a feature that allows buyers to send an offer for an item that has ended without being sold, closing the possibility of purchasing the item on the website. When a buyer sends a request, the seller receives a notification with the offer. If the seller accepts the offer, the request becomes binding for both parties. The offer is only active for 24 hours.
