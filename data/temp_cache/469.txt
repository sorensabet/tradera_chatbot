QUESTION: What do I do if my parcel is lost or damaged during transit?
ANSWER: If your parcel is damaged or lost in transit, you can start a claim. Claims for lost parcels can be started if the delivery time is more than 30 days, while claims for broken parcels must be started within 7 days from picking up the delivery. Parcels from Tradera that are sent with DHL are insured. If the parcel is lost or broken, you can be reimbursed up to the selling price of the item, with a maximum of 5000 SEK.

QUESTION: Who is responsible for packaging the parcel?
ANSWER: The sender is responsible for properly packaging the parcel so that it won't be broken in transit. The parcels are partially handled by machines and collected in cages during transit. The sender needs to ensure that the item is packed in such a way that the contents or other parcels won't be damaged by the package. Using enough packing material so that the item is immovable in the package is recommended. It is recommended that the package should be able to handle a fall from a table. Notes or text with the words "fragile/glassware" or similar won't give any extra protection since the parcels are handled by machines.
