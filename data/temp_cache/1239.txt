QUESTION: How does a Seller receive payment on Tradera?
ANSWER: The Seller receives payment in the same way as if the Buyer had chosen to pay by card or PayPal. After Paynova or Klarna has carried out a normal credit check of the Swedish Buyer, a payout will be carried out to PayPal (Hyperwallet). Once Tradera has carried out its check of the Transaction and it has been approved, a payout to the Seller’s account will be carried out.
