General
a)  When the Buyer buys an item at Tradera, there are several payment methods available through Tradera’s checkout solution. Such payment methods are card payment, PayPal, ApplePay and Google Pay. Each separate payment method is provided by third parties with whom Tradera cooperates for this purpose, and which are under the supervision of the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, or its foreign counterparts. The payment methods are offered by these payment solution providers and they decide which payment methods they want to offer you. Depending on the payment method that you choose, you may have to enter into a separate agreement with the relevant payment solution provider and you will have to accept the terms applicable to the payment method you choose to use. More parties may be added if Tradera chooses to modify or further develop Tradera's checkout solution.

Tradera is not responsible for delays, errors, damages or other matters relating to payment or non-payment of items purchased by the Buyer via Tradera's checkout solution. 
4. PAYOUT TO THE SELLER
a)  Once a Transaction has been approved by Tradera, a payment through Tradera's payout solution will be made to the Seller, either for a separate Transaction, or as a combined amount involving several Transactions. Before payment is made, any amount that the Seller is obliged to pay to Tradera will be deducted, and the difference will be paid to the Seller. The amounts that Tradera will deduct may relate to selling expenses, refundable amounts, and fees to Tradera agreed between the Seller and Tradera under separate agreement.
b)  The Seller shall, as a general rule, receive payment within one (1) to two (2) business days following the completion of a Transaction, provided that the Seller has provided accurate payment details to Tradera. The payment rate may be changed by Tradera, and it is up to the Seller to keep itself informed of information coming from Tradera in this respect. However, Tradera monitors the Transactions to detect irregularities. If, with respect to a particular Transaction, Tradera suspects that there are irregularities such as fraud, or that the Seller has previously acted in violation of these Terms and Conditions, Tradera's User Agreement or other Rules for Sellers, Tradera reserves the right to ensure that the payment is not made to the Seller, but instead to refund it to the Buyer. 
c)  If the Seller has not provided Tradera with accurate payment information, Tradera will not be able to pay the Seller. In such case, Tradera will contact the Seller to request the outstanding information. Once Tradera has received the information required to make the payment, the Seller will, as a general rule, be paid within two (2) business days.
d)  Upon Tradera's confirmation that the Buyer has made a payment, the Seller shall immediately send the goods to the Buyer, as described in more detail below under the description of each payment method. Tradera reserves the right to withhold payment if and for as long as there is a suspicion that the Seller will not fulfill his/her obligations.
e)  A Seller can, in most cases, contact Tradera on various matters which may arise in connection with a Transaction, even though the payment services themselves are not provided by Tradera, and irrespective of the payment method a Buyer chooses. 
Swedish customer's purchase by invoice or installments 
If a Swedish Buyer has chosen to pay via Paynova, the Seller accepts that PayPal takes over the Seller's right to be paid by the Swedish Buyer in exchange for PayPal to pay the Seller for the Transaction.
If a Swedish Buyer has chosen to pay via Klarna, the Seller transfers the right to receive payment from the Buyer to Tradera, and Tradera transfers such claim to Klarna. The Seller accepts that payment to the Seller in respect of the Transaction will be made via Hyperwallet. The Seller accepts that no claim for payment can be made against Klarna, such a claim shall instead be made against Hyperwallet who is responsible for the payment to the Seller.
If a Swedish Buyer chooses to pay by invoice or installment, the Swedish Buyer enters into an agreement with Paynova or Klarna. It is not the Seller who has to agree to payment by invoice or installment, but the Seller is paid in the same way as if the Buyer had chosen to pay by card or PayPal.
After Paynova or Klarna has carried out a normal credit check of the Swedish Buyer, a payout will be carried out to PayPal (Hyperwallet). Once Tradera has carried out its check of the Transaction and it has been approved, a payout to the Seller’s account will be carried out. 
Also, in the case of payment by invoice or installment, Tradera notifies the Seller via e-mail and in My Tradera that payment for the purchase has been made. The Seller should then send the goods to the Buyer. Also in this case, payments to the Seller's bank account will normally be made within 1–2 business days, provided that Tradera has received accurate information.
5. TRADERA'S RIGHT TO WITHHOLD AND RECOVER PAYMENTS FROM THE SELLER
Tradera has the right to withhold payment to the Seller or, if the Seller has already been paid, to require the Seller to pay the refundable amount to Tradera in the following cases:

Within the framework of Tradera's dispute settlement system, where Tradera considers that the Buyer is right.
Transactions resulting in the creation of a claim against a natural or legal person who Tradera can reasonably assume shares a financial interest with the Seller.
Transactions that are reasonably suspected to constitute money laundering, terrorist financing or otherwise violate applicable laws and regulations.
Transactions through which the Seller violates applicable law.
Transactions through which the Buyer acquires cash (e.g., currency exchange, a check, or similar).
Transactions where the Seller has not complied with the Terms and Conditions of Tradera's prevailing Seller Protection, if and when available.
Transactions that are in violation of the Terms and Conditions, Tradera's User Agreement or Rules for Sellers.
Transactions in which the Buyer, as a consumer, has used his/her statutory right of withdrawal against a Seller who is conducting business activities.

6. VOLUNTARY REPAYMENTS
a)  If a Transaction is to be fully or partly repaid by the Seller on the basis of an agreement between the Seller and the Buyer (e.g., if the Buyer has been granted a right of return by the Seller, or the Buyer has exercised his/her statutory right of withdrawal if the Buyer is a consumer and the Seller is a trader), it is up to the Seller to pay back part or the full amount to the Buyer. If the Seller and Buyer agree to a return or price reduction, this shall be promptly settled by the Seller, who shall refund the agreed amount to the Buyer up to 1000 SEK. The Seller must make refunds only through Tradera's checkout solution, and not through other payment methods.
b)  Due to the risk of fraud, the extent of refunds is limited, and the Seller may not refund transactions exceeding 1000 SEK. In order to refund transactions in excess of 1000 SEK, the Seller must first contact Tradera's customer service to receive instructions.
7. BUYER PROTECTION
a)  In certain circumstances, a Buyer is entitled to buyer protection, meaning that a Buyer can have a dispute handled via a dispute resolution process and be refunded an amount paid in a transaction. The highest amount that can be refunded, within the framework of the buyer protection, is 50,000 SEK.
b)  A buyer protection is included if the buyer chooses to pay through Paynova, PayPal or Klarna.   When paying with card, Google Pay, Apple Pay, or Swish, the Buyer can add Tradera's buyer protection for a charge. It is stated on Tradera's platform before the Buyer chooses the payment method whether buyer protection is included or can be purchased. The Seller must perform its obligations as far as concerns Tradera's buyer protection irrespective of the payment method chosen by the buyer.
c)  Certain types of purchases are never covered by Tradera's buyer protection. These are as follows:

Purchase of properties (including, without limitation, residential properties);
Purchase of vehicles (including, without limitation, motor vehicles, motorcycles, caravans, aircraft, and boats), except for private portable light vehicles used for recreational purposes, such as bicycles and wheeled hoverboards;
Purchase of customized objects (unless the recipient claims that the objects have not arrived);
Purchase of items equivalent to cash (including, without limitation, gift cards);
Purchase of tickets for events such as sports or concert tickets; and
Purchase of goods and services prohibited by Tradera's Rules for Sellers.

d)  This is how Tradera's dispute settlement procedure works:

If a Seller and a Buyer have a difference of opinion that, for example, is due to the Buyer not having received delivery of a paid item, or to the delivery of the goods according to the Buyer being substantially different from the Seller's description, the Parties may resolve their differences by means of the dispute settlement system offered by Tradera on "My Tradera". Such a dispute settlement procedure must be initiated in My Tradera within 30 days from the date of the purchase, and any communication about the dispute shall be made through Tradera's dispute settlement system on Tradera's Platform.
Once a dispute settlement procedure has been initiated, Buyer and Seller must first communicate with each other through Tradera's dispute settlement system to try to find a solution to the problem. If Buyer and Seller fail to reach a resolution within ten (10) days of the initiation of the dispute settlement procedure, the Buyer may escalate the dispute to Tradera. If the Buyer does not escalate the dispute to Tradera within ten (10) days of the initiation of the dispute settlement procedure, the dispute settlement procedure will automatically be terminated in the Seller's favor.
When a dispute is escalated to Tradera in accordance with above, Tradera will contact both Buyer and Seller to obtain an understanding of what has happened. Tradera may then ask both Parties for supporting evidence, such as additional documentation concerning the goods or Transactions. The Buyer is responsible for proving that there are errors in the service provided by the Seller, or the item sold by the Seller, e.g., by providing evidence that the goods differ from the Seller's description.

e)  Termination of the dispute settlement procedure:

If the Buyer initiates a dispute settlement procedure in which the purchase relates to a product not covered by Tradera's buyer protection in accordance with above, Tradera will terminate the dispute without further investigation, and the Buyer shall not be entitled to a refund.
If a dispute settlement procedure is terminated in favor of the Buyer, the Buyer shall be entitled to a refund, in part or in whole, of the amount paid by the Buyer for an item. 
If a dispute settlement procedure is terminated in favor of the Seller, the Buyer shall not be entitled to a refund within the framework of Tradera's dispute settlement procedure.
Tradera's decision in a case cannot be appealed to Tradera, but the Seller and Buyer are free to find another solution to a dispute in another forum.

8. THE SELLER'S OBLIGATIONS IN RELATION TO BUYER PROTECTION
a)  By accepting these Terms and Conditions, the Seller agrees to the terms and conditions of Tradera's buyer protection and dispute settlement procedures in accordance with the prevailing terms and conditions.
b)  The Seller undertakes to promptly respond to the Buyer's complaint through the dispute settlement procedure provided by Tradera on My Tradera. If the Seller does not promptly notify Tradera of the responses and supporting documents requested by Tradera, Tradera may find that the Buyer shall be entitled to a refund for a product without the Seller having given his/her opinion. If the Seller has already been paid, Tradera may then send an invoice to the Seller on the Refundable amount, and the Seller shall then be obliged to pay this amount to Tradera.
c)  The Seller must fulfill his/her obligations in relation to Tradera's buyer's protection, regardless of the payment method by which the Buyer has chosen to pay.
d)  Certain types of purchases are never covered by Tradera's buyer protection, see Section 7 c).
9. SELLER PROTECTION
a)  A Seller is entitled under certain conditions to Tradera's seller protection. Thus, by complying with the terms and conditions of Tradera's seller protection, the Seller may retain the payment received, even if the Buyer claims that the Buyer has never received an item, or that the item is not in accordance with the Seller's description.
b)  The following products are never covered by Tradera's seller protection:

Sale of properties (including, without limitation, residential properties);
Sale of vehicles (including, without limitation, motor vehicles, motorcycles, caravans, aircraft, and boats), except for private portable light vehicles used for recreational purposes, such as bicycles and wheeled hoverboards;
Sale of customized objects (unless the recipient claims that the objects have not arrived);
Sale of items equivalent to cash (including, without limitation, gift cards);
Sale of tickets for events such as sports or concert tickets; and
Sale of goods and services prohibited by Tradera's Rules for Sellers.

c)  In order for a Seller to be able to use Tradera's seller protection, the following conditions must be met:

The Seller shall send the goods to the delivery address approved by Tradera at the time of payment. If the Buyer's delivery address has changed after the purchase has been completed, Tradera will notify the Seller of this by means of the confirmation e-mail sent when the Buyer has paid for the goods, and the information will also be available in My Tradera.
Goods whose price exceeds 200 SEK must have been handed over to the Buyer by the Seller or by a carrier in order for the Seller to be covered by the seller protection. If the Buyer claims not to have received the delivery, Tradera will ask the Seller for evidence that the Seller, or the contracted carrier, has delivered the item or items to the Buyer. Tradera therefore recommends the Seller to send the goods with traceability, e.g., a tracking number from the carrier. 
The Seller must have chosen a mode of transport in which the goods sold are insured during transport up to the value of the goods. 
The Seller shall describe in text form and with photographs all goods in a satisfactory manner in the advertisement so that the Buyer can examine the goods and their condition before the Buyer enters into the contract with the Seller. The Seller must also deliver the goods to the carrier in the same condition as the Seller has described them in the advertisement.
The Seller shall have sent the goods to the Buyer in an appropriate manner; i.e., delivery should take place with all ordered goods being packaged and shipped in a manner that minimizes the risk of damage to the products.

10. PRICE AND COSTS
a)  Provided that the Seller acts in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, the transaction cost for payments with Tradera's checkout solution and Tradera's payout solution shall be zero (0) SEK, and no start-up, monthly, or annual fee will be payable to Tradera for the use of Tradera's checkout solution and Tradera's payout solution.
b)  If, however, the Seller acts in a manner which entails Tradera refunding Transactions to the Buyer in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, then Tradera may invoice the Seller for a recoverable amount.
11. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
Tradera reserves the right of ownership of all intellectual property rights in everything developed by Tradera to which the Seller has access under the Terms and Conditions and on Tradera's Platform. The Seller undertakes in particular not to use any characters, logos, symbols, or anything else that could be confused with Tradera's trademark.
12. PERSONAL DATA
Tradera's ordinary Privacy Policy will also apply to personal information handled by Tradera in connection with these Terms and Conditions. Personal data will also be handled independently by PayPal within the framework of the Hyperwallet service.  
13. MISCELLANEOUS
a)  The Seller shall be responsible for all actions taken through the use of the Seller's unique login to Tradera.
b)  These Terms and Conditions shall terminate, without obligation to Tradera for refund, in the event that Tradera terminates Tradera's User Agreement, or denies the Seller the right to sell additional goods on Tradera's Platform under the terms and conditions set forth in Tradera's User Agreement. Upon termination of these Terms and Conditions, Tradera has the right to withhold all payments to the Seller until Tradera has verified the number of outstanding Transactions and all withdrawal periods have passed, or any suspected abuse of Tradera's checkout solution and payout solution has been investigated.
c)  Neither the Seller, the Buyer nor Tradera shall be liable for failure to perform a service, or delays, if the cause is: lightning, sabotage, government action, power outage, deterioration of the Internet, or telecommunications, or any other event outside the party’s reasonable control. The foregoing shall apply for the duration of such a force majeure event. The Party invoking force majeure shall be obliged to take reasonable measures to limit the damage caused by the event. If the force majeure event lasts for more than sixty (60) days, each party shall be entitled to terminate the Terms and Conditions.
d)  Tradera's right to amend the Terms and Conditions is set out in Tradera's User Agreement.
e)  Over and above what is expressly provided in these Terms and Conditions, these Terms and Conditions fully govern the Buyer, the Seller or Tradera's agreement with respect to Tradera's checkout solution and Tradera's payout solution and supersede any prior verbal or written representations and any prior agreements between the Buyer, the Seller or Tradera regarding payment solutions on Tradera's Platform.
f)  The Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Swedish law. The Buyer, the Seller and Tradera agree that disputes relating to the Terms and Conditions shall be settled by the Swedish General Court, where the Stockholm District Court shall be the first instance.
14. TRADERA'S PARTNERS
